# Project rules — StackQL Anthropic provider factory

This repo masters TWO StackQL providers from one pipeline ("the factory"):

| Provider | Surface | Auth env var | Key type |
|---|---|---|---|
| `anthropic` | User/inference API (`/v1/messages`, models, batches, files, agents, sessions, skills, memory stores, vaults, ...) | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | `sk-ant-api...` (workspace-scoped) |
| `anthropic_admin` | Admin API (`/v1/organizations/*`: users, invites, workspaces, api_keys, usage/cost reports, rate limits, Claude Code analytics) | `ANTHROPIC_ADMIN_KEY` | `sk-ant-admin01-...` (org-scoped, admin-role-created) |

The two key types are disjoint (neither can call the other's endpoints) but the wire auth
structure is identical: `x-api-key` + `anthropic-version` headers.

Default branch: `main` (this is a PLAIN repo, not a fork — the `stackql-provider`
default-branch convention applies only to forked SDK repos). Rules marked
**(verified)** were empirically confirmed on the wire against stackql v0.10.542 during a
prior build — do not re-litigate them.

## Prior-art audit (do not redo)

- Anthropic's Python and TypeScript SDKs are Stainless-generated **from the same OpenAPI
  spec** and are in lockstep (116 configured endpoints each at audit time). Do not derive
  anything from SDK source code — SDK parameter names can be ALIASES of wire names
  (e.g. SDK `created_at_gte` is wire `created_at[gte]`). **The spec is canonical.**
- The spec is downloadable: `anthropics/anthropic-sdk-python` → `.stats.yml` →
  `openapi_spec_url` (Stainless storage, hash-named, updates per SDK release). At audit
  time: 126 operations / 85 paths, OpenAPI 3.1.0, beta paths pre-baked as `?beta=true`
  path keys, 521 anyOf / 227 oneOf / 161 allOf.
- Spec ops (126) = SDK-configured (116) + 10 `/v1/tunnels` ops (excluded from both SDKs;
  tunnels are managed via `workspace:manage_tunnels` OAuth, not API keys → we exclude too).
- The Admin API is in NO spec and NO SDK. Its canonical source is the platform docs —
  every reference page serves clean markdown at its `.md` URL (this is transcription,
  not scraping).

## The factory pipeline

### `anthropic` (spec-driven, pattern 1 with custom passes)

```
locate    read .stats.yml from anthropics/anthropic-sdk-python HEAD → openapi_spec_url;
          alert if openapi_spec_hash changed since the committed snapshot
download  fetch spec → vendor into stackql_anthropic_provider/provider-dev/downloaded/ (committed)
pre-pass  custom script:
            - downlevel OpenAPI 3.1 → 3.0 constructs (type arrays / null members) as needed
            - inject `anthropic-version` header param: required:false, default '2023-06-01'
            - stamp per-endpoint `anthropic-beta` defaults from the beta-flag table (below)
            - drop excluded ops: 2 SSE stream endpoints, 10 tunnels endpoints
split     monolithic spec → per-service specs using the path→service map (taxonomy below;
          the spec has no tags)
normalize @stackql/provider-utils `normalize` (anyOf/oneOf→allOf rewrite + merge; opaque
          objects → string/JSON-blob columns). Shallow by design — nested unions belong
          inside JSON columns.
analyze   @stackql/provider-utils mappings → `all_services.csv` (REVIEWED, committed,
          append-only; this is where resource/method/verb surgery lives — see few-shots)
generate  provider tree → provider-dev/openapi/src/anthropic/v00.00.00000/
post-pass custom script:
            - `requestBodyTranslate: {algorithm: naive}` + `request.mediaType` on every
              body-bearing method
            - `objectKey: $.data` on list envelopes
            - pagination config on cursor-style lists ONLY (policy below)
guards    CI hard-fails (below)
```

### `anthropic_admin` (docs-driven)

Hand-authored per-service specs in `stackql_anthropic_admin_provider/provider-dev/source/`
(transcribed from the reference pages listed below), entering the SAME chain at
normalize → analyze → generate → post-pass. ~24 operations; stable surface.

## Spike findings (Phase 0, 2026-07-08, spec hash d272f069e15d096063103c857fb8e2a7)

Messages service walked end-to-end (locate → download → pre-pass → split → normalize →
scrub → analyze → CSV review → generate → post-pass → stackql v0.10.542 load →
meta routes → mock SELECTs). All findings empirical:

- **(a) 3.1 constructs**: the spec has NO `type: [...]` arrays; the 3.1-isms are 478
  `{type: 'null'}` anyOf/oneOf members, 476 `const`, 23 numeric
  exclusiveMinimum/Maximum. `factory/pre-pass.mjs` downlevels all three (null members
  stripped + `nullable: true`, const→enum, exclusive→min/max) and stamps
  `openapi: 3.0.3`; the stackql loader accepts the result cleanly.
- **(b) Message-class schemas ARE SQL-shaped** after shallow normalize: `Message`
  projects id/type/role/content(array→JSON)/model/stop_reason/…/usage(object→JSON);
  `MessageTokensCount` projects `input_tokens`. POST-as-SELECT verified on a mock:
  WHERE keys pass into the JSON body via naive translate (`messages` string fans out
  to a real JSON array), the Message row comes back as a result set.
- **normalize is NOT sufficient for guard 4**: it leaves nested unions (48 oneOf in
  messages alone) and ~700 `additionalProperties` across services.
  `factory/scrub-unions.mjs` (new pipeline step, runs after normalize) collapses
  residual nested unions to opaque JSON-blob schemas and deletes every
  `additionalProperties` — all 12 services then scan clean.
- **Pagination classification** (from the spec, mechanical): 19 cursor lists
  (`page` query param + `$.next_page` in response — ALL beta lists) get pagination
  config; 3 after_id lists (models, GA batches, files) get none. `factory/post-pass.mjs`
  detects the cursor pattern structurally, no hand list.
- **Wire quirk**: stackql appends a bare `?` to request URLs when no query params are
  supplied (`POST /v1/messages?`). Harmless on real servers; mocks must parse the URL
  rather than string-match it.
- provider-utils@0.7.6 needs `@jsr:registry=https://npm.jsr.io` in `.npmrc`
  (dependency `@jsr/stackql__deno-openapi-dereferencer`).
- split's "Operations processed" log undercounts (prints 100, emits all 104 ops);
  count ops in the split output, not from the log.
- **stackql v0.10.542 EXEC panic (upstream bug, worked around)**: EXEC prepare
  SIGSEGVs (`wrappedSchema.GetType` on a nil inner schema, via
  `drm.GenerateSelectDML`) whenever the exec method's resolved response schema has NO
  array-typed property (MessageBatch, Workspace, BetaEnrollmentUrl, ...; schemas WITH an
  array property — Agent.tools, SendSessionEvents.data — are fine). Bare-scalar
  responses (binary downloads, `type: string`) fail differently:
  "no schema found for method", no dispatch. BOTH are fixed by stamping
  `response.schema_override` → a synthetic `StackqlExecResult` envelope (object with an
  array property) on exec-only methods matching either shape; `factory/post-pass.mjs`
  step 3 does this mechanically (18 methods in `anthropic`, 1 in `anthropic_admin`).
  All 23 anthropic EXEC methods + admin archive dispatch-verified. Report upstream.
- EXEC invocation syntax: multiple params need commas —
  `EXEC t.r.m @a = 'x', @b = 'y'` (space-separated @params is a parser error).

## Output rules (both providers)

### 1. Auth — `type: custom`, NOT `api_key` **(verified)**

```yaml
config:
  auth:
    type: custom
    location: header
    name: x-api-key
    credentialsenvvar: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY   # ANTHROPIC_ADMIN_KEY for anthropic_admin
```

`type: api_key` puts `api_key <key>` in the Authorization header regardless of
location/name. Only `type: custom` sends `x-api-key`.

### 2. Header defaults are auto-injected **(verified)**

Stackql injects an optional (`required: false`) HEADER param's `schema.default` into the
request when not supplied in SQL; query-param defaults are NOT injected; a
`required: true` header param must be satisfied in every WHERE clause (the original
provider's worst UX wart — never regress to it). Hence: `anthropic-version` optional with
default `'2023-06-01'` on every op; per-endpoint `anthropic-beta` optional with the flag
default on beta ops.

### 3. Beta endpoints — `?beta=true` baked into path keys **(verified)**

The spec already models beta paths as `/v1/agents?beta=true`; stackql sends the path key
verbatim on the wire. Keep them; do not model `beta` as a query parameter.

### 4. Beta-flag defaults table

The spec declares the `anthropic-beta` header but NOT the per-endpoint flag constants
(that's Stainless config). Maintain a small checked-in table
(`factory/beta-flags.yaml`), extracted at build time from the published PyPI `anthropic`
package (`pip download anthropic` → grep resource modules for
`extra_headers = {"anthropic-beta": "<flag>"`). **Verified against anthropic==0.116.0
(2026-07-08)** — the audit-time list was wrong for three services. Actual table
(checked into `factory/beta-flags.yaml`): `managed-agents-2026-04-01`
(agents/deployments/deployment_runs/environments/sessions/vaults),
`agent-memory-2026-07-22` (memory_stores), `files-api-2025-04-14` (files),
`skills-2025-10-02` (skills), `user-profiles-2026-03-24` (user_profiles).

### 5. No polymorphism; flat SQL-result-set rows

Final specs contain no anyOf/oneOf/allOf/additionalProperties. One level of named
properties; deeper structures are JSON columns. `normalize` does the heavy lifting;
the guards (below) enforce the result.

### 6. Pagination — two schemes, two policies **(verified)**

- Cursor lists (`page` request param, `$.next_page` in response, nulls out on last page):
  stamp `config.pagination: {requestToken: {key: page, location: query}, responseToken:
  {key: $.next_page, location: body}}`. Auto-pagination wire-verified (multi-page walk).
- `after_id`/`before_id` + `has_more`/`last_id` lists (models, GA batches, files, and ALL
  admin entity lists): NO pagination config — `last_id` stays populated on the final page
  (infinite-loop risk). Keep cursor params for manual paging.

### 7. Request bodies — naive translator **(verified)**

Every body-bearing method: `request.mediaType: application/json` + `config:
{requestBodyTranslate: {algorithm: naive}}`. SQL keys pass straight into the JSON body,
required body fields surface WITHOUT `data__` prefixes, and JSON-typed values fan out
(`messages = '[{"role":"user",...}]'` arrives as a real array — works in SELECT WHERE,
INSERT, UPDATE SET).

### 8. SQL-verb mapping

`create→INSERT`, `retrieve→get/SELECT`, `list→SELECT`, `update→UPDATE`, `delete→DELETE`;
lifecycle/rpc ops (`archive`, `cancel`, `pause`, `unpause`, `run`, `redact`, `ack`,
`heartbeat`, `poll`, `stop`, `send`, `add`, `mcp_oauth_validate`,
`create_enrollment_url`) → EXEC. Exceptions: inference ops (`messages` create,
token counting, legacy `complete`) → SELECT (the result IS a result set); multipart
`files` upload → EXEC; JSONL `batches` results → EXEC.

### 9. ONE select shape per resource — split divergent shapes into separate resources

Stackql resolves a resource's table columns from its select methods; methods with
different response schemas must NOT share a resource. Enforced by a build guard.
See few-shots below.

### 10. Reserved-word and grammar check

Every service/resource/method name must survive
`SHOW METHODS IN <provider>.<service>.<resource>` in stackql's SQL parser.
Known trap: `work` (COMMIT WORK) → renamed `work_items`.

### 11. YAML 1.1 booleans **(verified)**

Stackql's Go YAML parser is YAML 1.1 — quote `y/yes/no/on/off/...` when they appear as
strings/keys (`YAML.stringify(..., {version: '1.1'})` in Node; custom str representer
in Python).

### 12. MDX-safe descriptions

Single-line; HTML stripped; bare `<placeholders>` and `{braces}` backticked. Website
runs sanitize + scrub passes; scrub removes the auto-injected header params from
generated SQL samples and backtick-quotes hyphenated identifiers.

## Few-shots for the mappings review (`all_services.csv`)

The CSV follows the provider-utils analyze contract
(`filename,path,operationId,...,stackql_resource_name,stackql_method_name,stackql_verb,
stackql_object_key,op_description`), keyed `filename::operationId`, append-only after
first review. Use REAL operationIds from the spec (e.g. `messages_post`,
`complete_post`); the ones below illustrate the decisions:

**Few-shot 1 — divergent select shapes → separate resources.** `POST /v1/messages`
returns a `Message` row (id, model, role, content, stop_reason, usage...);
`POST /v1/messages/count_tokens` returns `{input_tokens}`. Same noun, different shapes →
two resources:

```csv
messages.yaml,/v1/messages,messages_post,create,post,#/components/schemas/Message,,,messages,create,select,,Send a structured list of input messages...
messages.yaml,/v1/messages/count_tokens,messages_count_tokens_post,count_tokens,post,#/components/schemas/MessageTokensCount,,,token_counts,count_tokens,select,,Count the number of tokens in a Message...
```

**Few-shot 2 — reserved SQL word → rename.** `/v1/environments/{id}/work...` ops map to
resource `work_items`, never `work`:

```csv
environments.yaml,/v1/environments/{environment_id}/work?beta=true,...,list,get,...,work_items,list,select,$.data,...
```

**Few-shot 3 — required-param signature clash → relocate, don't demote.** `work/stats`
(GET, requires `environment_id`) clashes with `work_items.list` (same signature) in the
select bucket. Relocate to its own selectable resource instead of losing it to EXEC:

```csv
environments.yaml,/v1/environments/{environment_id}/work/stats?beta=true,...,get,get,...,work_stats,get,select,,...
```

**Few-shot 4 — lifecycle and non-SQL payloads → exec.**

```csv
agents.yaml,/v1/agents/{agent_id}/archive?beta=true,...,archive,post,...,agents,archive,exec,,Archive Agent
files.yaml,/v1/files?beta=true,...,upload,post,...,files,upload,exec,,Upload File (multipart - not SQL-expressible)
messages.yaml,/v1/messages/batches/{message_batch_id}/results,...,results,get,...,batches,results,exec,,JSONL stream of batch results
```

**Few-shot 5 — trust wire names, not SDK names.** The spec's query params
`created_at[gte]` / `created_at[lte]` are correct; the SDK's `created_at_gte` is a
client-side alias. Emit the bracketed wire names (backtick-quoted in SQL samples).

## Taxonomies (agreed — changes need explicit confirmation)

### `anthropic` — 12 services, 26 resources

messages (messages, token_counts, batches) · models (models) · completions (completions)
· agents (agents, versions) · deployments (deployments, deployment_runs) · environments
(environments, work_items, work_stats) · files (files) · memory_stores (memory_stores,
memories, memory_versions) · sessions (sessions, events, resources, threads,
thread_events) · skills (skills, versions) · user_profiles (user_profiles) · vaults
(vaults, credentials).

Excluded, documented: 2 SSE stream endpoints, 10 tunnels ops (OAuth-only), SDK-side
conveniences (`parse`), beta duplicates of GA messages/batches/models (fold into GA).

### `anthropic_admin` — 6 services, 11 resources (~24 ops)

organization (organization[get /me], users, invites) · workspaces (workspaces, members,
rate_limits) · api_keys (api_keys — list/get/update ONLY; the API forbids create/delete)
· usage (usage_reports, claude_code_reports) · cost (cost_reports) · rate_limits
(rate_limits).

Excluded, documented: WIF endpoints (service accounts / federation issuers / rules —
reject admin keys, need `org:admin` OAuth); Compliance / Spend Limits / Enterprise
Analytics (third key type `sk-ant-api01-...` → future `anthropic_enterprise`). Note in
docs: on Claude Platform on AWS only workspace CRUD works.

Admin open questions — RESOLVED empirically on the mock (2026-07-08), pinned:
(a) **Report row shape: ship `$.data`.** stackql's objectKey DOES support
`$.data[*].results[*]` (row per bucket×group, auto-pagination still walks), but those
rows lose the bucket's `starting_at`/`ending_at` (absent from result items), which are
the x-axis of any usage report. So usage/cost/claude_code use `$.data` (row per bucket:
starting_at, ending_at, results as a JSON column; JSON_EACH for group breakdowns).
(b) **Array query params take ONE scalar value per query.** `WHERE "group_by[]" =
'model'` reaches the wire as `group_by%5B%5D=model` (URL-encoded brackets, accepted).
A JSON-array value does NOT fan out — it arrives as the literal string (unlike request
bodies under naive translate). Quote bracketed identifiers with DOUBLE QUOTES in SQL:
backtick-quoting `` `group_by[]` `` is a stackql parser error (note: this corrects the
"backtick-quoted in SQL samples" instruction in few-shot 5 — backticks only work for
bracket-free identifiers).
(c) **`ending_at` is optional** on both usage_report/messages and cost_report (canonical
reference pages) — routing signatures are `[starting_at]` only; no clash.
(d) **fast-mode: optional header, NO default.** `anthropic-beta` is declared on
usage/cost ops as an optional header param without a default; users grouping/filtering
by `speed` supply `anthropic-beta = 'fast-mode-2026-02-01'` in the WHERE clause.
Also: usage/cost/claude_code reports and both rate_limits endpoints are CURSOR-paginated
(`page` + `next_page`) and get pagination config — the after_id policy applies only to
the admin ENTITY lists (users/invites/workspaces/members/api_keys).

## Build guards (CI hard-fails)

1. **Spec-coverage diff**: official spec ops minus provider ops must equal EXACTLY the
   documented exclusion list. This is the 100%-coverage requirement, mechanized.
2. **Select-shape consistency**: within a resource, all SELECT methods project the same
   column set.
3. **Signature uniqueness**: within (resource, sqlVerb), no two methods share a
   required-params signature (most-specific-first ordering; clashes demote to EXEC —
   or better, relocate via CSV).
4. **No-polymorphism scan**: zero anyOf/oneOf/allOf/additionalProperties in generated
   services.
5. **`.stats.yml` drift check**: fail regen when upstream `openapi_spec_hash` differs
   from the vendored snapshot (conscious bump required).
6. **Zero-column selects**: every SELECT-routed method projects ≥1 column.

## Tests (both providers)

- **Meta routes** (must pass): pgwire harness walks every service/resource/method
  (SHOW SERVICES/RESOURCES/METHODS + DESCRIBE EXTENDED), owns the server lifecycle,
  zero errors. Archetype: stackql-registry/stackql-provider-aws → `bin/test-meta-routes.cjs`.
- **Smoke** (manifest-driven, per provider): mock mode default — a local mock of the API
  that REJECTS wire-contract violations (missing `x-api-key` → 401, missing
  `anthropic-version` → 400, beta path without `anthropic-beta` → 400) and serves a
  2-page cursor list to prove pagination walks; the suite copies the generated registry
  to a temp dir and rewrites `servers:` to the mock. Live mode gated on the provider's
  env var; admin live tests are READ-ONLY (never mutate live orgs).

## Microsites — two, Netlify

One Docusaurus 3.10 site per provider (`anthropic-provider.stackql.io`,
`anthropic-admin-provider.stackql.io`), vendored shared config
(stackql/docusaurus-config cloned to `.shared-config` at build), docgen via
`@stackql/provider-utils` (latest), `sharp` pinned `^0.33` via resolutions (0.32
downloads binaries from GitHub releases, which breaks in restricted environments).
Deployment is Netlify (NOT GitHub Pages — one Pages site per repo): mirror the layout in
stackql-registry/stackql-provider-databricks (`stackql-provider` branch) — per-site base
directories, selective builds. Admin site auth docs: Admin key, admin-role-created,
org accounts only; cross-link the `anthropic` site (and vice versa).

Known docgen bug — PATCHED LOCALLY (2026-07-08): provider-utils includes
`requestBody.required` in "Required Params" only for insert/update/replace/exec access
types, so SELECT-routed body methods (inference ops) rendered empty Required Params and
unroutable samples. `factory/patch-provider-utils.mjs` (npm postinstall) adds `select`
to the allowlist in `docgen/resource/methods.js` and appends body-required fields to
SELECT example WHERE clauses; the upstream diff is prepared at
`factory/upstream/provider-utils-select-required-params.patch`. Delete the local patch
once a provider-utils release contains the fix.

More website findings (2026-07-08): Docusaurus 3.10 with `future: {v4: true}` requires
the `@docusaurus/faster` package (build hard-fails without it). `factory/scrub-docs.mjs`
post-processes docgen SQL samples: auto-injected header params removed,
hyphenated/bracketed identifiers DOUBLE-quoted (backticks are a stackql v0.10.542
parser error for both shapes — supersedes the backtick advice in few-shot 5 and the
MDX-safe rule).

Websites re-platformed (2026-07-08, post-merge) onto the NEW archetype from
stackql-registry/stackql-provider-aws (`stackql_aws_provider/website`, branch
`stackql-provider`; deployment vector excluded — this repo stays on Netlify):
- `provider.js` (providerName/providerTitle) + THIN `docusaurus.config.js` calling
  `createConfig` from `./.shared-config/index.js`; the shared config is VENDORED AT
  BUILD TIME (`yarn vendor-config` = rimraf + shallow-clone of
  stackql/docusaurus-config@main, wired as prestart/prebuild; `.shared-config/` is
  gitignored, never committed).
- Docusaurus ^3.10.1 with faster/plugin-ideal-image/theme-mermaid + the archetype's
  overrides/resolutions block. plugin-ideal-image pulls sharp 0.32 → binary download
  breaks here; sharp pinned `^0.33` in BOTH overrides and resolutions (kept on top of
  the archetype, which doesn't pin it).
- MONOREPO exception: createConfig derives projectName/editUrl as
  `stackql-provider-<name-sans-underscores>` — wrong for this repo. Both site configs
  post-mutate `config.projectName = 'stackql-provider-anthropic'` and the per-site
  `presets[0][1].docs.editUrl`. The providerSlug-derived url
  (anthropic-admin-provider.stackql.io from `anthropic_admin`) IS correct as-is.
- The shared config supplies blog:false, markdown hooks, redirects plugin
  (/providers/*, /install, ... route to the main site client-side), gtag, sitemap.
  docgen frontmatter references `/img/stackql-<providerName>-provider-featured-image.png`
  — alias it from stackql-cover.png in each site's static/img.

## Things NOT to do

- Don't derive params/schemas from SDK source (alias trap). SDKs are only used for the
  `.stats.yml` pointer and the beta-flag constants.
- Don't enable auto-pagination on `after_id`-style lists.
- Don't emit `required: true` for `anthropic-version`/`anthropic-beta`.
- Don't hand-edit generated provider trees — fix the pass or the CSV and regen.
- Don't rewrite existing CSV rows (append-only); bootstrap deletions are deliberate acts.
- Don't put WIF/Compliance/Spend-Limits under either provider's auth.
- Don't use GitHub Pages for the sites.
